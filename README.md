Blackjack Game
    Players aim to achieve a hand value close to 21 without exceeding it.
    Options include "hit" for additional cards or "stand" to keep the current hand.
    The player with the hand closest to 21 wins, factoring in dealer behavior and Ace values.

Dice Game
    Players predict the outcome of a dice roll.
    After placing a guess, the dice are rolled, and results are compared.
    Correct predictions lead to rewards, while incorrect ones challenge players to refine their strategy.
    Our project demonstrates proficiency in various technical aspects:

Server Setup: We are utilizing Node.js and Express to set up the server, managing routes, and handling client requests.

Client-side Rendering: Our web app adopts a Single Page Application (SPA) approach. This is achieved by dynamically updating content using JavaScript.

jQuery AJAX: We employ AJAX techniques to facilitate smooth communication between the client and server, fetching game results and managing interactions.

File Handling: The server reads data from both JSON and CSV files, enhancing game functionality and player experience.

HTTP Methods: We utilize HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and PATCH to manipulate and retrieve data from the server.

CORS Configuration: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured to enable secure interactions between the client and server.
